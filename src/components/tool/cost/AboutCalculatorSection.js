      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        The first challenge one usually encounters when building a house is not knowing how much the unit will cost to construct because there are several variables that might affect the cost such as the quality and type of materials used, the number of floors, and whether or not the house will be built by you or a construction company. Zameen has launched its new house construction cost calculator tool to provide its users with a reliable way to estimate the construction costs of their houses.
        <br /><br />
        If you want to build your dream home, you can quickly estimate the construction cost with our Construction Cost Calculator. This tool makes it simple to estimate home building costs. Simply enter the city where you intend to build your home, choose the area of the house in Marla or Kanals, and choose the quality of the materials you wish to use.
        <br /><br />
        You will get the estimated construction costs including grey structure cost, contractor cost, finishing cost and price per sqft. The price of the grey structure is determined by adding the cost of the basic framework, such as pillars, walls, beams, cement, and steel structure while the finishing cost is calculated by taking into account the finer details, which include tiles, bathroom fixtures, doors, and other components.
